# I want to be able to call nested_sum from main w/ various nested lists
# and I greatly desire that the function returns the sum.
# Ex. [1, 2, [3]]
# Verify you've tested w/ various nestings.
# In your final submission: 
#  - Do not print anything extraneous!
#  - Do not put anything but pass in main()
